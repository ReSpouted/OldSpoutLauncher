# OldSpoutLauncher

Launcher for Spoutcraft 1.6.4

This uses [a patch](https://github.com/ReSpouted/Grease) along with [RetroMCP](https://github.com/ReSpouted/RetroMCP-Legacy)
to reconstruct Spoutcraft's source code without sharing the entirety of Minecraft's code.

**This program must be run with java 8 to work properly.** If you don't know what this means or how to do so, there are
plans to make the process more straight forwards, so you might want to wait until that's done before using this.
